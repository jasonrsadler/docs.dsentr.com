# Welcome to DSentr

DSentr (pronounced "de-CEN-ter" ["/diˈsɛn.tɚ/"]) helps you connect apps, automate tasks, and run custom logic without writing backend code.  
This documentation covers everything from building your first workflow to integrating APIs and managing teams.

---

## What you can do

- **Automate workflows** – Chain triggers and actions across your favorite services.  
- **Connect integrations** – Use built-in nodes for Slack, Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, email, and more.  
- **Add logic** – Include conditional branches, delays, and code steps when you need flexibility.  
- **Collaborate** – Invite teammates, manage roles, and share workspace resources.  
- **Monitor runs** – View execution history, debug errors, and optimize performance.

## Quick start

1. **Sign in:** Go to [app.dsentr.com](https://app.dsentr.com) and create an account.  
2. **Create a workflow:** Choose a trigger (like a webhook) and connect an action (like posting to Slack).  
3. **Test and run:** Execute once, review the log output, and enable the workflow.  
4. **Share:** Invite others to your workspace and start collaborating.
