# Account Setup

Setting up your DSentr account takes only a few minutes.  
Follow these steps to create your workspace, connect integrations, and prepare your first workflow.

---

## 1. Create your account

Go to [app.dsentr.com](https://app.dsentr.com) and click **Sign Up**.

You can register using:
- **Google** or **GitHub** for instant access  
- **Email and password** if you prefer a standalone login  

After sign-up, verify your email if prompted. Verification helps secure your account and enables integration access.

---

## 2. Create your workspace

Once logged in, you’ll be asked to create or join a workspace.

A **workspace** is your shared environment for workflows, connections, and members.  
- Solo users automatically get a personal workspace.  
- Teams can invite others with specific roles: Owner, Admin, User, or Reader.  
- Each workspace has its own plan, billing, and resource limits.

You can create additional workspaces anytime from your profile menu.

## 3. Connect integrations

Open the **Connections** page in the sidebar.  
Here you can securely link your favorite apps and services:

| Service | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Slack** | Action | Requires a Slack webhook or OAuth app |
| **Google Sheets** | Action | Needs OAuth and a sheet ID |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Action | Uses webhook connector URL or OAuth |
| **Google Chat** | Action | Uses a webhook connector URL |

Your connected integrations appear as selectable options in workflow nodes.

## 4. Invite teammates (Workspace Plans Only)

From **Workspace Settings → Members**, invite users by email.  
Choose their role when sending the invite:
- **Owner:** full control over billing and settings  
- **Admin:** manage workflows and members  
- **User:** build and run workflows  
- **Reader:** view-only access

Pending invitations show in both sender and recipient dashboards until accepted.

---

## 5. Confirm everything works

After setup:
1. Visit your workspace dashboard.  
2. Click **New Workflow**.  
3. Add a webhook trigger and a Slack action.  
4. Test-run it. You should see your Slack message appear. (See the **Next Step** *Your First Workflow* for more details)

If it runs, your account is ready.

## Next step

Move on to **[Your First Workflow](./first-workflow.md)** to start building automations.
