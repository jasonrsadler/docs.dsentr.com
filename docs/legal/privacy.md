# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how DSentr (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our application, website, and related services (“the Service”).  
By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Account Information
When you register or sign in, we collect your name, email address, and authentication details.  
If you sign in through a third-party provider (such as Google or Microsoft), we receive basic profile information and access tokens required to operate the integrations you authorize.

### Subscription and Billing Information
We use third-party payment processors (for example, Stripe) to handle billing.  
Payment details are processed directly by Stripe under their security and privacy policies.  
DSentr does **not** store credit card numbers or other payment card data.

### Workflow and Integration Data
When you connect integrations or run workflows, DSentr processes configuration details, trigger inputs, and output data as part of normal operation.  
This data is retained only as long as necessary to execute and log workflows.

### Usage and Technical Data
We collect standard technical data automatically, including IP address, browser type, device information, and usage logs.  
This helps maintain performance, detect abuse, and improve the Service.

### Cookies and Analytics
The Service uses cookies for authentication and session management.  
We may also use analytics tools to understand feature usage and reliability.  
You can disable non-essential cookies in your browser settings.
