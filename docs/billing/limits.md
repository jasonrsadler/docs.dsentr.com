# Usage Limits

To keep DSentr efficient and fair for all users, each plan includes defined usage limits for workflow executions, concurrency, and retention.  
These limits ensure predictable performance while providing clear upgrade paths as your automation needs grow.

## Solo Plan (Free)

The Solo plan is designed for individuals exploring DSentr or testing small automations.  
It offers a fully functional environment but with strict limits to prevent misuse.

- **Executions:** 250 runs per month (hard cap).  
- **Concurrency:** 1 run at a time (no parallel executions).  
- **Integrations:** API key–based connections only (OAuth not supported).  
- **Log Retention:** 7 days of execution logs.  
- **Intended Use:** Prototyping, experimentation, or light personal automation.

Solo accounts are a great way to get familiar with the platform, but production-grade workflows should use a Workspace plan for higher throughput and team collaboration.

## Workspace Plan ($29/mo)

The Workspace plan is built for teams and professionals running continuous or shared automations.  
It provides more execution capacity, higher concurrency, and longer retention, with optional overages for flexibility.

- **Executions Included:** 10,000 runs per month.  
- **Overage:** $1.00–$2.00 per additional 1,000 runs beyond the included quota.  
  - Runs beyond the included amount are billed automatically on the next invoice cycle.  
  - Overages do not interrupt workflow execution.  
- **Concurrency:** Up to 10 simultaneous runs.  
- **Integrations:** Full access to OAuth and API key connections.  
- **Log Retention:** 45 days of workflow logs and execution history.  
- **Intended Use:** Shared workflows, production automations, and integrations requiring higher throughput.

The Workspace plan ensures workflows continue running smoothly even during spikes in activity.  
Instead of hard cutoffs, DSentr uses soft limits with transparent overage billing—your automations stay live, and you only pay for the additional usage you need.

Additional plans with higher limits, custom concurrency, and longer retention may be introduced in the future as part of DSentr’s scaling tiers.
