# Workflows

The **Workflows** tab lists all workflows currently part of the workspace.  
From here, you can permanently delete workflows that are no longer needed.

## 1. Deleting a workflow

To delete a workflow:

1. Select the workflow you want to remove.  
2. Type the **workspace name** exactly as shown to confirm deletion.  
3. Click **Delete Workflow**.

Deletion is immediate and cannot be undone.  
All run history, logs, and associated data for that workflow are removed from the workspace.

## 2. Notes

- Only workspace **Owners** and **Admins** can delete workflows.  
- Workflows deleted here are not recoverable.  
- If a deleted workflow was connected to external integrations or secrets, those connections remain intact for other workflows.

This page is currently focused on workflow removal.  
Future versions may expand to include additional management tools such as workflow archiving, renaming, or exporting.
