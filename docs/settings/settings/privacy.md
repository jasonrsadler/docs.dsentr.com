# Privacy

The **Privacy** section lets you control how your workflow configurations may be used to improve the DSentr platform.  
By default, DSentr may analyze workflow setups across users to identify common patterns and enhance automation features.

---

## 1. Help improve DSentr

Allow DSentr to analyze your workflow structures to discover useful patterns and guide feature development.  
This analysis focuses on workflow design — not on personal or secret data — and helps improve reliability, integrations, and user experience.

If your workflows contain proprietary logic or confidential automation strategies, you can uncheck this box to opt out of analysis.

Click **Save Preferences** to apply your choice.

## 2. What this means

When enabled:
- DSentr may review anonymized workflow configurations to identify trends and optimize common use cases.  
- No credential data, secrets, or message contents are accessed or stored.  
- Insights are aggregated and used only for platform improvements.

When disabled:
- Your workflows will not be included in analysis or pattern discovery.  
- Functionality and access remain unaffected.

The **Privacy** setting gives you control over whether your workflow designs contribute to improving DSentr — opt in to help refine the platform, or opt out to keep your configurations entirely private.
